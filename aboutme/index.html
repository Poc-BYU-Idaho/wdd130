    <h2>Blake</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Blake. I enjoy swimming, boating, snowboarding, kayaking, and lifting. I am single with no children. I am not currently employed, but I might get a part-time job while I'm in college. The thing I love most about BYU-Idaho is its affordability combined with its close proximity to my house.
    <p>I am majoring in software engineering. An advantage I see from learning about careers in web design is that I can become familiar with HTML. I am taking this course because it is required for my degree.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church my entire life, but I do not have a favorite scripure or talk.</p>
