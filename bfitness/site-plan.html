        Benefits of Physical Fitness

Increased Strength, Power, and Bone Density - Staying physically fit can improve both maximal strength and speed. This is not only great for sports and athleticism, but for living a long and enjoyable life. People who strength train and exercise regularly generally age much better and can take care of themselves for much longer than others. As stated by Wolff's Law, bone density is also increased through load. This can reduce the increased risk of injury that comes with old age.
A Stronger Heart - Exercise has been shown to significantly reduce the chance of heart disease thus further increasing lifespan and ability to take care of oneself with age.
Mental Effects - Exercise has been shown to improve sleep, increase happiness, and lower the chance of developing depression. Runners often report experiencing a "runner's high" after a run, and lifters often revel when they have a "pump" or inflated muscles after exercise.
A longer, happier life - With its many combined benefits, exercise has the ability to greatly increase both the quality and length of your life. You can even have fun in the process by competing in sports, working out with friends, and watching your progress.

      <p>
        Fitness Disciplines

Powerlifting - A sport where the goal is to lift as much combined weight as possible in the squat, bench, and deadlift. Competitors are sotred into weight classes and are given three chances to complete each lift.
Strongman - The challenges in this discipline are decided by event holder, but they usually have a few things in common. Extreme feats of strength are put on show through a variety of obscure lifts and exercises. Sometimes endurance is also judged by putting competitors through timed strength events.
Bodybuilding - In this discipline, competitors prepare to be judged by their appearance on a stage through the use of resistance training and dieting.
Olympic Lifting - A sport where the goal is to lift a barbell overhead using two methods: The snatch and the clean and jerk. Athletes in this sport are sorted into weight classes and are scored by the combined weight they can lift overhead between the two lifts.
Crossfit - The challenges in this discipline are decided by the event holder, but they usually have a few things in common. The endurance of the athletes is almost always tested through the use of timed workouts with many repetitions. Strength and power are usually tested as well through the use of the olympic lifts.
Track and Field - This sport is comprised of various contests. They usually involve running, sprinting, and jumping. Athletes are not required to compete in all categories, and they usually specialize in just one.
Long-Distance Running - In this sport, competitors typically run distances that are 3km or further. It is largely a test of aerobic and muscular endurance.

Muscular Hypertrophy - The increase of muscle size.
VO2 Max - The maxmimum rate of oxygen consumption attainable during physical exertion.
Progressive Overload - The gradual increase of workout intensity, difficulty, or length with the goal of continually stimulating adaptions in the body.
SRA - An acronym standing for stimulus recovery adaptation. It describes the way that the body improves itself in response to a stimulus or exercise.
Aerobic - Requiring oxygen. This term is often used to indicate activites such as long-distance running where the heart and cardiovascular system are the main source of energy.
Anaerobic - Without oxygen. This term is often used to indicate activites such as sprinting where energy already stored in the muscles are the main source of energy.
Concentric - The contraction or shorting of a muscle. An example of this is curling a bar upwards by contracting your biceps.
Eccentric - The opposite of a concentric contraction. This refers to the muscle being lengthened. An example of this is squatting down in a controlled manner by lengthening your quadriceps.
