        <h3>Increased Strength, Power, and Bone Density</h3>
        <p>
            Staying physically fit can improve both maximal strength and speed. This is not only great for sports and athleticism, but for living a long and enjoyable life. People who strength train and exercise regularly generally age much better and can take care of themselves for much longer than others. As stated by Wolff's Law, bone density is also increased through load. This can reduce the increased risk of injury that comes with old age.

        <h3>Mental Effects</h3>
        <p>
            Exercise has been shown to improve sleep, increase happiness, and lower the chance of developing depression. Runners often report experiencing a "runner's high" after a run, and lifters often revel when they have a "pump" or inflated muscles after exercise.

            With its many combined benefits, exercise has the ability to greatly increase both the quality and length of your life. You can even have fun in the process by competing in sports, working out with friends, and watching your progress.
